## AI Agent Automation Tips

- **Non-Interactive Execution**: Always pass affirmative flags (e.g., `--yes` or `--confirm`) to prevent hanging in interactive prompts.
- **Repository Context**: Supply `-R OWNER/REPO` (or `GH_REPO=OWNER/REPO`) if executing outside a cloned git working directory.
- **Authentication**: Ensure `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set in headless environments.
